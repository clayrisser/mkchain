# mkchain

> chained actions for makefiles

Create complex cached dependency chains that track changes on
individual files. It can be used to format the code and run tests against
only the files that updated. This significantly increases the speed of builds
and development in a language and ecosystem agnostic way without sacrificing
enforcement of critical scripts and jobs.
